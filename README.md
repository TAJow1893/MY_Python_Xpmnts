# My Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my coding journey and projects as a student at *Mississippi State University*.

## Plan

This repository is a space for me to grow my programming skills and document my learning. I plan to use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks to create interactive code-based assignments and track progress over time.
